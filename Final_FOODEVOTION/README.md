# FOODEVOTION

FOODEVOTION is an interactive installation that captures the relationship between people and their inner craving. It asks the audience one simple question, **“If you could have ANY food in the world right now, what would you wish for?” **

It has a main web interface that takes user input through a simple textbox and a P5.js blank canvas. The images are saved into a folder that lives on the server and then the data is being sent from client to the server using UDP network. Finally, the server side sent the data to a Parse database and at the same print the requests real time. Below is the diagram of how it works:
